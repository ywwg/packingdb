* Separate contexts and properties better
 * they should have separate positions in the csv
 * they should have separate divisions in the list of addable props
 * no auto-add property with the name of a context
* complete my stateful list change, try to upstream it
 * (scroll position changes unnecessarily so we need to persist it)
 * or include in my own tree
* try to split checkboxes out from Strings()
* pgup pgdn -- even possible?
